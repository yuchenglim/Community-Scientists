##### Temperature Scale

A practical effect ... is that the triple points and the freezing/melting points of its thirteen chemical elements are precisely known ... since these thirteen values are **fixed by definition**.

In 2019, the kelvin was redefined. However, the alteration was very slight compared to the ITS-90 **uncertainties**

There are often small differences between measurements calibrated per ITS-90 and thermodynamic temperature ... the boiling point of VSMOW water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C) when adhering strictly to the **two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature**.

**Estimates of the differences** between thermodynamic temperature and the ITS-90 (T − T90) were published in 2010.

### Physical Chemistry
Electrochemistry:  
Plambeck Electroanalytical chemistry   
Bard Faulkner electrochemical methods  

Read Plambeck to get a feel of the physical nature of the experiments

Read B&F Ch.2: best intuition for thermodynamics (assumes elementary understanding)

Concept of state: between can be reversible/irreversible. Reversible allows you to calculate the states, given macroscopic changes.
