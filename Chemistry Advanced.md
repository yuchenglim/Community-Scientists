### Temperature Scale
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Temperature_Scale_of_1990

A practical effect ... is that the triple points and the freezing/melting points of its thirteen chemical elements are precisely known ... since these thirteen values are **fixed by definition**.

In 2019, the kelvin was redefined. However, the alteration was very slight compared to the ITS-90 **uncertainties**

There are often small differences between measurements calibrated per ITS-90 and thermodynamic temperature ... the boiling point of VSMOW water under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339 K (99.9839 °C) when adhering strictly to the **two-point definition of thermodynamic temperature**.

**Estimates of the differences** between thermodynamic temperature and the ITS-90 (T − T90) were published in 2010.
