The best way to understand is to challenge your understanding with WILD examples, tough problems. It's better to read more books than to search the web for a specific answer. Anyway, here are specific topics + literature.

üíúThe "oxidation number" is a theoretical value used to do electron bookkeeping and is one way of comparing the number of electrons "owned" by an atom in a molecule or ion versus how many valence electrons present in the atom as depicted on the periodic table.

üíúWhy do metals form metallic bonds among tthemselves? How can we predict/expain it based on its atomic structure, shells etc? How about electronegativity?

A molecular orbital diagram showing both the bonding and anti‚Äêbonding molecular energy levels is provided below. (McQuarrie & Simon, Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach, p. 388)  
Methane has eight valence electrons, so according to the aufbau and Pauli exclusion principles the two lowest energy molecular orbitals (2a1 and 1t2) are fully occupied with electrons. This is consistent with the experimental valence electron ionization spectrum for methane shown below. (McQuarrie & Simon, Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach, p. 388)  
The VBT model appears to predict only one valence electron ionization energy for methane, because there is only one kind of bonding electron ‚Äì an electron in a carbon sp3 hybridized orbital which overlaps with a tetrahedrally located hydrogen 1s orbital. To see how VBT accounts for two ionization energies see the following reference: Journal of Chemical Education, 89, 570‚Äê572 (2012).
