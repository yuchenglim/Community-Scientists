It's better to read more books than to search the web for a specific answer. Anyway, here are the topics + literature.

A molecular orbital diagram showing both the bonding and anti‐bonding molecular energy levels is provided below. (McQuarrie & Simon, Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach, p. 388)  
Methane has eight valence electrons, so according to the aufbau and Pauli exclusion principles the two lowest energy molecular orbitals (2a1 and 1t2) are fully occupied with electrons. This is consistent with the experimental valence electron ionization spectrum for methane shown below. (McQuarrie & Simon, Physical Chemistry: A Molecular Approach, p. 388)  
The VBT model appears to predict only one valence electron ionization energy for methane, because there is only one kind of bonding electron – an electron in a carbon sp3 hybridized orbital which overlaps with a tetrahedrally located hydrogen 1s orbital. To see how VBT accounts for two ionization energies see the following reference: Journal of Chemical Education, 89, 570‐572 (2012).
