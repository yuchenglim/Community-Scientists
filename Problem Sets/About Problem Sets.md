The best way to learn is by doing problems the way the inventors did it: thought experiments, inventing your own problems etc. 

P.S. some problems are not original. I either searched Physics Stackexchange (PSE), Physics Forums and Math SE.

Other problems are written as I read textbooks. I actually summarised the text in the form of problems. Somehow I can understand more...

There files are meant to provide examples of how one might go about doing this; they are not meant to be complete.
