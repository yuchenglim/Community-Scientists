The best way to learn is by doing problems the way the inventors did it: thought experiments, inventing your own problems etc. 

P.S. some problems are not original. I either searched Physics Stackexchange (PSE), Physics Forums and Math SE.

Other problems are written as I read textbooks. I actually summarised the text in the form of problems. Somehow I can understand more by doing so...

There files are meant to provide examples of how one might go about doing this; they are not meant to be complete.

Just as how we learn languages by copying down sentences with advanced phrases embedded in them, we ought copy down full problems and solutions of the hardest and most illuminating problems. Collecting them into your own tiny problem book is definitely worth the effort!
