# Community-Scientists: Whoever you are, whatever you do, do real Science, for a change
Elo! I should have introduced myself earlier. Thanks to Marcus, Ryan and Tyler who gave me the courage to write this.

A little about me:~  
I'm nothing. I just spent too much time reading books. You can do it too! I have faced many ugly problems in life.

**Do you really need motivation to study?**

Life is about problem solving. This world is awful, there are many problems, pick one and solve it! Solve it not for any reward. True happiness comes when we can work hard without asking for anything in return!

The problem I sought to gain insight about is, how to self-study graduate Mathematics and Physics? How to study when you feel bored? How to build an NMR machine? How was Schrodingerâ€™s equation discovered? And apparently, the proper way to learn Science is to solve problems in their natural context. Not cookie-cutter problems, but problems that led to discovery.

P.S. Scientists refer to themselves as Science workers: all they do is solve problems (Science is not as glamorous, exciting! Imagine running through 10 textbooks, solving every problemâ€¦). å·¥åŒ ä¹‹å¿ƒ. Yet to them, work is play! Can you make studying even more interesting than video games? *Go with the flow: you and books only*

**But where to find hard, illuminating problems? The key point is to not rely on any teacher, but self-study! Explore on your own!**

**But itâ€™s so hard! How to study? Hereâ€™s some homework to get you started:**
- Print out the whole A-levels syllabus
- Visit the library and get A-levels/**first year university textbooks** (Physics, Chemistry). Read!
- Print out a list of Physics and Chemistry Nobel Laureates and their topics. Aim to learn everything!
- AMISO: IPhO, IChO, IOAA roadmap + what resources. Kevin Zhouâ€™s advice.

**How to discipline yourself? How to overcome bad habits?**
Talk to someone, ask them to discipline you! Give them your phone! Going against the grain.
For Buddhists, I recommend reading Dhamma talks by Ajahn Chah (Theravada, Thai forest monks). For non-Buddhists, you don't need this. Just in case, view Buddhism not as a religion, but just a bunch of wise people and tips and tricks on how to overcome bad habits.

We flush down detergents, drain cleaners and ðŸ’©. How do all these get treated?

How do enzymes catalyze reactions? How do industrial catalysts work? How are they discovered? Why were these chosen over others?

How did Chemists narrow down to pure compounds and construct a periodic table? How did chemists who did not have access to spectrocopes discover isomerism, via purely chemical methods!? (of course, melting points...)

How are Math Olympiad problems created anyway?...

Is there a way to learn everything in ones lifetime? 

How do they know it?

Live to learn, solve problems, share knowledge and help others learn. There's no point asking companies, politicians to change. They are always monopolizing knowledge! Break this monopoly by learning more, making knowledge available, free of charge! Break the technological black box!


____________________________________________________________


Can we know it too? Why must students *rely* on teachers? Why would we rely on politicians, companies, doctors, professionals, leaders to make all decisions in our lives? Why would we mindlessly let companies dictate our lifestyle, let politicians manipulate our sanity? Why not we learn more ourselves? I mean, everyone learns more! 

(how companies shape our eating habits, for their own good!)
