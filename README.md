## Community Scientists

Chemistry really is the art of drawing the perfect hexagon, writing the perfect H (and writing it fast!), drawing the perfect skeletal structure, and giving the perfect explanation with native English (thanks Ms. Rathi!).

Physics, Mathematics, Engineering, is the art of drawing the perfect straight line, the most informative diagram (thanks Ms. Logesh!), calculating without formulas, simulating without computers (!)

Experimental Physics (and Chemistry) is the wisdom and foresight of ensuring everyone is safe while blowing things up :)

Sorry NY Times, but I have to reproduce this amazing article. Please do not sue me! Here’s the pdf version:

Life really is about being diligent: if no one scrubs the toilet, you scrub it. If these companies don’t change, closing them down is the worst solution. Why don’t we provide free scrubbers, as a community? Someone can do the design, someone can install, some one can source the materials.

Why do we need patents, copyrights if we as a community are willing to support the original inventors and boycott infringements? (hopefully the inventors will not try to monopolize and reap a profit!) Can we appreciate those who share knowledge and not free-ride? 

Such an attitude can help in relationships too: if you have naggy parents, why can’t you just listen to them, wear their shoes and help them worry less? If your other half does not change, why can’t you change for the better?

If you have some dark secrets or bad-habits that you can’t change on your own, and that you are unwilling to share, try sharing them with someone. Change only takes two steps, and this is the first step.

Being diligent need not be tiring. It can be a rewarding experience. “Go against the grain”. It just takes a bit of creativity.

Why do Community Science? We can only practice loving-kindness, responsibility and conscience if we live in a community, sharing knowledge and working together (sacrificing for each other). Science is only the sole language and art that can share this love.

P.S. To all those I’ve talked to, who love drawing, why not do Chemistry? You can draw and invent something at the same time :)
