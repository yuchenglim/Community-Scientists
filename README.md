# Community-Scientists!?

We flush down detergents, drain cleaners and ðŸ’©. How do all these get treated?

How do enzymes catalyze reactions? How do industrial catalysts work? How are they discovered? Why were these chosen over others?

How did Chemists narrow down to pure compounds and construct a periodic table? How did chemists who did not have access to spectrocopes discover isomerism, via purely chemical methods!? (of course, melting points...)

How are Math Olympiad problems created anyway?...

Is there a way to learn everything in ones lifetime? 

How do they know it?

Why learn more?

![learn_x_protest](https://github.com/yuchenglim/Community-Scientists/blob/main/Images/learn_x_protest.png)

Live to learn, solve problems, share knowledge and help others learn. There's no point asking companies, politicians to change. They are always monopolizing knowledge! Break this monopoly by learning more, making knowledge available, free of charge! Break the technological black box!

Can we know it too? Why must students *rely* on teachers? Why would we rely on politicians, companies, doctors, professionals, leaders to make all decisions in our lives? Why would we mindlessly let companies dictate our lifestyle, let politicians manipulate our sanity? Why not we learn more ourselves? I mean, everyone learns more!
