(4:15 comparison; ethanol vs hexane: different colours!)

Reaction with NaCl with MgCl2  
MgCl2 hydrated vs anhydrous: hydrated, just dissolves (pH 6.5). Anhydrous, highly exothermic and can even vaporize the water! Also releasing HCl. Resulting in an ALKALINE solution!  
https://youtu.be/8bKzoFLVedY?si=1czEWtUlEY08Rk7t  
(So this is why addnig AlCl3 to water releases lot's of vapour... Even if water in excess, heat cannot be transported away from surface quickly enough where it reacts, and HCl cannot diffuse fast enough down into the solution, resulting in formation of HCl fumes....)  
aluminium chloride and water  
https://youtu.be/tzZgjhKdcEA?si=DIxmf8J3VvaO5TFt

Silicon tetrachloride with excess water: heavier than water so sinks! Steamy white fumes too! As HCl produced too fast and escapes before it can dissolve

Sulfuric acid is commonly supplied at concentrations of 78, 93, or 98 percent. Due to its affinity for water, pure anhydrous sulfuric acid does not exist in nature.  
https://www.britannica.com/science/sulfuric-acid


Two types of reactions might occur when concentrated sulfuric acid is added to a solid ionic halide like sodium fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide. The concentrated sulfuric acid can act as both an acid and an oxidizing agent.

When someone says "x is titrated against y" which is in the burette and which is in the flask?  
The titrand is titrated with the titrant.  
The titrand (or analyte) is the stuff in the flask.  
The titrant is the stuff in the buret.

In acidic solutions, H2O2 is a powerful oxidizer, stronger than chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate.

However, potassium permanganate is reduced to Mn2+ by acidic H2O2.  
????  
In basic solutions, hydrogen peroxide is a strong reductant and can reduce a variety of inorganic ions. When H2O2 acts as a reducing agent, oxygen gas is also produced.  
(That's why I always had to add NaOH, only then something would happen!)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide

The mixture of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide produces a strong oxidizer called sodium peroxide and can result in an exothermic mist from the onset of high temperatures and heat from the decomposition of incompatible mixtures causing a severe thermal hazard.
