Meaning of permanance  
https://dept.harpercollege.edu/chemistry/chm/100/dgodambe/thedisk/labtech/titrate2.htm

When someone says "x is titrated against y" which is in the burette and which is in the flask?  
The titrand is titrated with the titrant.  
The titrand (or analyte) is the stuff in the flask.  
The titrant is the stuff in the buret.

In acidic solutions, H2O2 is a powerful oxidizer, stronger than chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and potassium permanganate.

However, potassium permanganate is reduced to Mn2+ by acidic H2O2.  
????  
In basic solutions, hydrogen peroxide is a strong reductant and can reduce a variety of inorganic ions. When H2O2 acts as a reducing agent, oxygen gas is also produced.  
(That's why I always had to add NaOH, only then something would happen!)  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide

The mixture of sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide produces a strong oxidizer called sodium peroxide and can result in an exothermic mist from the onset of high temperatures and heat from the decomposition of incompatible mixtures causing a severe thermal hazard.

But sodium peroxide hydrolyzes in water

sulfite and KMnO4

Identification of Carbonate : Salt Analysis series NCERT  
-> carbonate powder is soft, fluffy like facepowder  
-> limewater test without a delivery tube!  
-> limewater plus a little CO2 vs excess CO2  
Identification of Nitrite : Salt Analysis series NCERT  
-> Crystalline, unlike carbonate  
Identification of Sulphite(Sulfite) : Salt Analysis series NCERT  
-> barium chloride followed hydrochloric acid  
Identification of Bromide : Salt Analysis series NCERT  
-> Silver nitrate test: dissolves in excess! Partially soluble means hard to dissolve, but will dissolve!

Reflux - Oxidation of Ethanol - Chemistry A-level Practial  
https://youtu.be/aUEpAEaSsBU?t=219  
Start the oxidation immediately! RTP  
2 signs of the reaction happening:  
highly exothermic: bubbling, steaming  
Change in colour`  
Ethanal

Water bath: maximum temperature!

Thermometer: level with junction  
Temperature of the vapour only

Carboxylic acid, needs reflux

Lesson: many organic reactions are equilibrium reactions. So even though small amounts are produced by many imaginable procedures, the methods we learn are for optimum yield.
