Nucleophile:  A species (molecule or ion) which attacks a positive site in something else. Nucleophiles are either fully negative ions or contain a fairly negative region somewhere in a molecule. All nucleophiles have at least one active lone pair of electrons. When you write mechanisms for reactions involving nucleophiles, you must show that lone pair.
